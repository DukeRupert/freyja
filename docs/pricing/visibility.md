# Product Visibility

Control which customers can see which products.

## Visibility Options

Each product has a visibility setting:

| Setting | Who Can See |
|---------|-------------|
| **Public** | Everyone (retail and wholesale) |
| **Wholesale Only** | Only approved wholesale customers |
| **Hidden** | No one (draft/discontinued products) |

## Setting Visibility

1. Open the product for editing
2. Find the **Visibility** field
3. Select the appropriate option
4. Save the product

## Use Cases

### Public
Most products should be public:
- Standard retail offerings
- Products available to all customers
- Your main catalog

### Wholesale Only
Use for products exclusive to wholesale:
- Bulk sizes (5lb bags)
- Wholesale-exclusive blends
- Products with margins too thin for retail

### Hidden
Use for products not ready for sale:
- Products being developed
- Discontinued items
- Seasonal products not currently available

## How Visibility Works

### For Retail Customers
- See all **Public** products
- Cannot see Wholesale Only or Hidden products
- Products they can't see don't appear in search or browsing

### For Wholesale Customers
- See all **Public** products
- See all **Wholesale Only** products
- Cannot see Hidden products

### For Anonymous Visitors
- See all **Public** products
- Must create account and be approved for wholesale to see more

## Combining with Price Lists

Visibility and price lists work together:

1. **Visibility** controls who sees the product
2. **Price Lists** control what price they pay

Example:
- 5lb bag is **Wholesale Only**
- Has prices in Wholesale Tier 1, 2, and 3 price lists
- Only wholesale customers see it
- They see the price from their assigned tier

## Tips

- Default new products to **Hidden** while building them out
- Switch to **Public** when ready to sell
- Use **Wholesale Only** sparingly—most products work for both channels
- Review visibility when discontinuing products
