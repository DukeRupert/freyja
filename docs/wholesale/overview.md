# Wholesale Overview

How wholesale works in Freyja.

## What Makes an Account Wholesale?

Wholesale accounts have:

- **Account type**: Set to "Wholesale"
- **Wholesale pricing**: Assigned to a wholesale price list
- **Net terms** (optional): Can pay via invoice instead of checkout
- **Access**: Can see wholesale-only products

## The Wholesale Journey

### 1. Application
Customer creates account and submits wholesale application with:
- Business information
- Estimated order volume
- Business type

### 2. Review
You review the application:
- Verify business legitimacy
- Evaluate fit for wholesale program
- Decide on approval

### 3. Approval
If approved, you configure:
- Assign wholesale price list
- Set net terms (if offering)
- Any special arrangements

### 4. Ordering
Customer can now:
- See wholesale pricing
- View wholesale-only products
- Place orders with net terms

### 5. Invoicing
For net terms customers:
- Orders don't require immediate payment
- Invoices generated (manually or consolidated)

## Wholesale Pricing
