# Fulfillment Workflow

Process orders from payment to shipment.

## Daily Fulfillment Process

### 1. Review New Orders

1. Go to **Orders**
2. Filter by **Paid** status
3. Review orders ready for fulfillment

### 2. Plan Your Batch

Consider grouping orders by:
- Shipping speed (expedited first)
- Product (grind multiple at once)
- Destination (regional batches)

### 3. Mark as Processing

As you start each order:
1. Open the order
2. Change status to **Processing**
3. This moves it out of the "Paid" queue

### 4. Pick and Pack

For each order:
- Verify items against order details
- Weigh and grind coffee as needed
- Package securely
- Include any inserts (cards, samples)

### 5. Create Shipping Label

1. In the order detail, click **Create Label**
2. Verify shipping address
3. Select carrier/service
4. Purchase the label
5. Print and affix to package

### 6. Mark as Shipped

After label is created:
- Status automatically updates to **Shipped**
- Customer receives shipping confirmation email
- Tracking number is recorded

### 7. Hand Off to Carrier

- Schedule pickup or drop off at carrier location
- Carrier scans packages into their system

## Order Details Page

The order detail page shows everything you need:

- **Customer info**: Name, email, phone
- **Shipping address**: Where to send
- **Line items**: What they ordered
- **Order notes**: Any special instructions
- **Status**: Current state
- **History**: All status changes

## Handling Issues

### Address Problems
- Verify address before shipping
- Contact customer if address seems incomplete
- Use address validation if enabled

### Inventory Shortages
- If an item is unavailable, contact customer
- Offer alternatives or partial fulfillment
- Process refund for unavailable items if needed

### Special Requests
- Check order notes for customer requests
- Accommodate when possible
- Communicate if you can't fulfill a request

## Tips for Efficiency

- **Batch similar orders**: Grind same coffee for multiple orders at once
- **Prepare supplies**: Keep boxes, labels, tape ready
- **Set a schedule**: Regular fulfillment times (e.g., 10am and 3pm)
- **Use status filters**: Work through Paid → Processing → Shipped
