# Understanding Price Lists

Price lists let you offer different pricing to different customer segments.

## What is a Price List?

A price list is a named collection of prices for your products. Each customer is assigned to exactly one price list, which determines the prices they see.

## Default Price List

Every store has a default "Retail" price list:

- Used for anonymous visitors
- Used for new customer accounts
- Cannot be deleted

## Creating a Price List

1. Go to **Price Lists** in the sidebar
2. Click **Add Price List**
3. Enter a name (e.g., "Café Tier 1")
4. Save the price list

## Setting Prices

After creating a price list:

1. Click into the price list
2. You'll see all your products
3. Set a price for each product/variant
4. Save changes

### Price Inheritance

- If a product has no price in a list, the **base price** is used
- Set prices only where they differ from base price
- This reduces maintenance when base prices change

## Assigning Customers

To assign a customer to a price list:

1. Go to **Customers**
2. Click on the customer
3. Select their **Price List**
4. Save changes

The customer will immediately see prices from their assigned list.
