# Net Terms

Offering payment terms to wholesale customers.

## What Are Net Terms?

Net terms allow wholesale customers to pay after receiving their order:

- **Net 15** - Payment due 15 days after invoice
- **Net 30** - Payment due 30 days after invoice
- **Net 60** - Payment due 60 days after invoice

This is standard practice in B2B commerce.

## Setting Up Net Terms

### Per Customer
1. Go to **Customers**
2. Open the wholesale customer
3. Click **Edit**
4. Select **Net Terms** option
5. Save changes

### Available Terms

| Terms | Due Date |
|-------|----------|
| Due on Receipt | Immediate payment |
| Net 15 | 15 days |
| Net 30 | 30 days |
| Net 60 | 60 days |

## How Net Terms Work

### Order Placement
1. Customer places order
2. No payment required at checkout
3. Order created with "Pending Invoice" status

### Invoice Generation
1. You create invoice for the order(s)
2. Invoice sent to customer
3. Due date set based on terms

### Payment
1. Customer pays before due date
2. Payment recorded in Freyja
3. Invoice marked as paid

## Who Should Get Net Terms?

Consider offering net terms to:

- Established business relationships
- Customers with good payment history
- Higher volume accounts
- Accounts where it's industry standard

Consider NOT offering to:

- New accounts (start with pay-at-checkout)
- Customers with payment issues
- Very small accounts

## Managing Risk

### Start Conservative
New wholesale accounts might start with:
- Payment at checkout
- Or Net 15 terms

Then extend to Net 30 after establishing trust.

### Credit Limits
Consider setting credit limits:
- Maximum outstanding balance
- Pause orders if limit reached
- Review limits periodically

### Monitor Aging
Watch for:
- Late payments
- Aging invoices
- Patterns of slow payment

## Overdue Invoices

When invoices go past due:

1. Invoice automatically marked overdue
2. Reminder notifications sent
3. Follow up personally if needed
4. Consider restricting future orders

## Changing Terms

To change a customer's terms:

1. Open customer detail
2. Edit net terms setting
3. Save changes

Changes apply to future invoices. Existing invoices keep original terms.
