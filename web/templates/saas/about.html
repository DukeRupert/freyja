      About Freyja
    </h1>

    <div class="mt-8 prose prose-neutral max-w-none">
      <p class="text-lg text-neutral-600 leading-relaxed">
        Freyja is an e-commerce platform built exclusively for coffee roasters. We provide the business-critical features that small roasting operations need to sell both direct-to-consumer and wholesale, without the enterprise pricing or complexity of general-purpose platforms.
      </p>

      <h2 class="mt-12 text-xl font-semibold text-neutral-900">The Problem We Solve</h2>
      <p class="mt-4 text-neutral-600">
        Small coffee roasters face a difficult choice when setting up e-commerce. General platforms like Shopify handle B2C well, but B2B is an afterthought requiring expensive plugins. Wholesale-focused platforms are overbuilt and overpriced for small producers.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-4 text-neutral-600">
        The result: roasters either overpay for features they need, cobble together fragile integrations, or simply don't offer capabilities that would grow their business.
      </p>

      <h2 class="mt-12 text-xl font-semibold text-neutral-900">Our Approach</h2>
      <p class="mt-4 text-neutral-600">
        By building exclusively for coffee products, we eliminate the complexity that general-purpose platforms must carry. This focus lets us provide integrated B2C and B2B functionality, subscriptions, and invoicing all in one system at a price that makes sense for small businesses.
      </p>

      <h2 class="mt-12 text-xl font-semibold text-neutral-900">Why "Freyja"?</h2>
      <p class="mt-4 text-neutral-600">
        Freyja is the Norse goddess associated with prosperity and abundance. The name reflects our goal: helping small coffee businesses thrive.
