## How Addresses Work

- Set a default shipping address
- Select saved addresses at checkout

## Viewing Customer Addresses

2. View **Addresses** section
3. See all saved addresses

## Address Information

Each address includes:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Name | Recipient name |
| Street | Street address |
| Line 2 | Apartment, suite, etc. |
| City | City name |
| State | State/province |
