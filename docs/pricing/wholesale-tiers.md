# Setting Up Wholesale Tiers

Create pricing tiers for your wholesale customers.

## Why Use Tiers?

Wholesale tiers let you offer different pricing based on:

- Order volume
- Business type
- Relationship length
- Strategic partnerships

## Planning Your Tiers

Before creating price lists, decide on your tier structure.

### Example: Volume-Based Tiers

| Tier | Monthly Volume | Discount |
|------|---------------|----------|
| Wholesale 1 | $500-1,000 | 20% off retail |
| Wholesale 2 | $1,000-2,500 | 30% off retail |
| Wholesale 3 | $2,500+ | 40% off retail |

### Example: Business-Type Tiers

| Tier | Business Type | Discount |
|------|---------------|----------|
| Café | Coffee shops | 25% off |
| Restaurant | Restaurants | 20% off |
| Office | Corporate offices | 15% off |

## Creating Tiers

### Step 1: Create Price Lists

1. Go to **Price Lists**
2. Click **Add Price List**
3. Name it (e.g., "Wholesale Tier 1")
4. Repeat for each tier

### Step 2: Set Prices

For each price list:

1. Click into the price list
2. Set prices for each product variant
3. Save changes

**Tip:** Start with your highest discount tier and work up. This makes it easier to ensure consistent margins.

### Step 3: Document Criteria

Keep notes on what qualifies customers for each tier:
- Minimum order volumes
- Business requirements
- Any other criteria

## Assigning Tiers to Customers

When approving wholesale applications:

1. Go to **Customers**
2. Find the wholesale customer
3. Review their application and order potential
4. Assign appropriate price list
5. Save changes

## Moving Customers Between Tiers

As customers grow:

1. Review their order history
2. Open their customer record
3. Change price list assignment
4. Save changes

Consider reviewing tier assignments quarterly.

## Pricing Strategy Tips

### Maintain Margins
Calculate your costs and ensure each tier maintains acceptable margins.

### Round Numbers
Wholesale customers appreciate clean pricing (e.g., $12.00 vs $12.37).

### Consistency
Apply similar discount percentages across products for simplicity.

### Communicate Value
Make sure wholesale customers understand the value they're getting at their tier.
