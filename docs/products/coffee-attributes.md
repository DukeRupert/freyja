# Coffee Attributes

Freyja includes coffee-specific attributes to help customers discover and understand your products.

## Available Attributes

### Origin
The country where the coffee was grown.

Examples: Ethiopia, Colombia, Brazil, Kenya, Guatemala

### Region
The specific growing region within the country.

Examples: Yirgacheffe, Huila, Sul de Minas, Nyeri, Antigua

### Producer
The farm, estate, or cooperative that produced the coffee.

Examples: Konga Cooperative, Finca El Injerto, Fazenda Santa Ines

### Process
The method used to process the coffee cherries.

| Process | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Washed | Fruit removed before drying, clean and bright flavors |
| Natural | Dried with fruit intact, fruity and sweet |
| Honey | Partial fruit removal, balanced sweetness |
| Anaerobic | Fermented without oxygen, complex flavors |
| Wet-Hulled | Indonesian method, earthy characteristics |

### Roast Level
How dark the coffee is roasted.

| Level | Characteristics |
|-------|-----------------|
| Light | Bright acidity, origin flavors prominent |
| Medium-Light | Balanced, some roast development |
| Medium | Classic coffee flavor, balanced |
| Medium-Dark | Fuller body, some roast character |
| Dark | Bold, roast-forward flavors |

### Tasting Notes
Flavor descriptors that help customers understand what to expect.

Examples:
- "Blueberry, jasmine, citrus"
- "Chocolate, caramel, nutty"

### Elevation
The altitude where the coffee was grown, typically in meters.

Examples: "1,800-2,000m", "1,500m", "1,200-1,400 masl"

Higher elevations often correlate with more complex, acidic coffees.

## Why Attributes Matter

### For Customers

## Best Practices

### Consistency
- Use consistent formatting (e.g., always "Ethiopia" not sometimes "Ethiopian")
- Standardize roast level names across products
- Format elevation consistently

### Completeness
- Fill in all attributes you have information for
- Update if sourcing changes
- Leave blank if unknown (better than guessing)

### Tasting Notes
- Be specific and accurate
- 3-4 notes is typical

1. Open the product
2. Update the relevant fields
3. Consider noting the change in the description
4. Save the product
