# Freyja

## Project Purpose

Freyja is an e-commerce platform built exclusively for coffee roasters. It provides the business-critical features that small roasting operations need to sell both direct-to-consumer and wholesale—without the enterprise pricing or complexity of general-purpose platforms.

## The Problem

Small coffee roasters (1-5 locations) face a difficult choice when setting up e-commerce:

**General platforms (Shopify, WooCommerce, BigCommerce)**
- Handle B2C well but B2B is an afterthought or expensive add-on
- Wholesale pricing tiers, net terms, and custom billing intervals require plugins that cost $50-300/month each
- Subscription functionality often requires yet another paid app
- None of these tools understand coffee—roasters end up hacking together solutions for roast dates, grind options, and origin metadata

**Wholesale-focused platforms**
- Built for large distributors, not small producers
- Overcomplicated for a roaster doing $200k-2M in annual revenue
- Pricing reflects enterprise sales cycles, not small business budgets

**The result:** Roasters either overpay for features they need, cobble together fragile integrations, or simply don't offer capabilities (like subscriptions or proper wholesale accounts) that would grow their business.

## The Solution

Freyja provides a focused, affordable platform that treats B2C and B2B as equally important from day one.

**Core thesis:** By building exclusively for coffee products, we eliminate the complexity that general-purpose platforms must carry. This lets a solo developer build and maintain what would otherwise require a team, passing the cost savings to customers.

**What this means in practice:**

- Product catalog designed around coffee attributes (origin, process, roast level, tasting notes) rather than generic product fields
- Flexible pricing with multiple price lists built-in, not bolted on
- Subscriptions as a first-class feature, not a third-party integration
- Wholesale accounts with net terms, custom billing cycles, and minimum order quantities included
- A single, predictable price rather than à la carte app fees

## Target Customer

Independent coffee roasters with 1-5 retail locations who:

- Sell roasted coffee online (B2C) and want to grow or formalize wholesale (B2B)
- Currently use a patchwork of tools or a platform that doesn't quite fit
- Have revenue between $200k-2M annually
- Value reliability and simplicity over endless customization options
- Would rather pay a fair, predictable price than negotiate enterprise contracts

## What Freyja Is Not

- A general-purpose e-commerce platform (we will never sell "products"—only coffee)
- A marketplace (each instance serves one roaster)
- A platform for large-scale distributors or multinational coffee companies
- A point-of-sale system (focused on online sales, not in-store)

## Success Criteria

Freyja succeeds if a small roaster can:

1. Set up a complete online store in a day, not a week
2. Manage both retail and wholesale customers in one place
3. Offer subscriptions without integrating a third-party service
4. Invoice wholesale accounts on flexible terms without spreadsheets
5. Pay a price that makes sense for their business size

## Project Name

Freyja is the Norse goddess associated with prosperity and abundance. The name reflects the project's goal: helping small coffee businesses thrive.
