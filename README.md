Everything you need to sell coffee online—retail, wholesale, subscriptions—one flat price.

*Launching Spring 2026*

## The Problem

Small coffee roasters face a difficult choice when selling online:

- **General platforms** handle B2C well, but wholesale pricing, net terms, and subscriptions require expensive plugins ($150-350/month total)
- **Wholesale platforms** are overbuilt and overpriced for businesses doing $200k-2M annually
- **None of them understand coffee**—roasters hack together solutions for roast dates, grind options, and origin metadata

The result: roasters overpay for fragmented tools or simply don't offer capabilities that would grow their business.

## Who It's For

Independent roasters with 1–5 locations who sell online and want to grow wholesale—without paying for enterprise software they'll never fully use.

## About the Name

Hiri is the name for the traditional trade voyages of the Motu people of Papua New Guinea. For centuries, Motu traders sailed large multi-hulled canoes called *lakatoi* along the Gulf of Papua, exchanging clay pots for sago. The trade language developed for these voyages—Hiri Motu—became one of Papua New Guinea's three official languages.

The name reflects both the project's purpose (enabling trade) and its origin (the founder grew up in a Motu village).

## The Solution

Hiri provides integrated B2C and B2B e-commerce at a flat $149/month—no plugins, no transaction fees.
