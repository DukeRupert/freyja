# Subscription Plans

Setting up subscription offerings for your products.

## What is a Subscription Plan?

A subscription plan connects a product SKU to recurring billing:

- Links to a specific product variant (weight + grind)
- Defines available frequencies
- Sets subscription pricing
- Creates corresponding Stripe Price

## Creating Subscription Plans

Subscription plans are created per product variant (SKU):

1. Go to **Products**
2. Open the product
3. In the variant section, find **Subscription Settings**
4. Enable subscriptions for that variant
5. Set subscription price
6. Save changes

## Pricing Subscriptions

### Subscription Discount
Many roasters offer a discount for subscribing:

| Retail Price | Subscription Price | Discount |
|-------------|-------------------|----------|
| $18.00 | $16.20 | 10% off |
| $52.00 | $46.80 | 10% off |

### Setting Prices
- Set subscription price on each variant
- Can be same as retail or discounted
- Price used for all frequency options

## Frequency Options

All subscription plans offer these frequencies:

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Weekly | Every 7 days |
| Every 2 weeks | Every 14 days |
| Monthly | Every calendar month |
| Every 6 weeks | Every 42 days |
| Every 2 months | Every 60 days |

Customers choose their preferred frequency at checkout.

## Products Best for Subscriptions

Consider enabling subscriptions for:

- **Core blends** - Your most popular, always-available coffees
- **House blends** - Consistent flavor profiles
- **Standard sizes** - 12oz bags for home consumers

Consider NOT enabling for:

- **Limited releases** - One-time availability
- **Seasonal coffees** - Won't always be available
- **Wholesale sizes** - B2B typically orders as needed

## Managing Plans

### Editing Plans
1. Open the product
2. Update subscription settings
3. Save changes

Changes apply to new subscriptions. Existing subscriptions continue on their original terms.

### Disabling Plans
1. Open the product
2. Disable subscription option
3. Save changes

Existing subscriptions continue but new subscriptions can't be created.

## Best Practices

### Availability
Only enable subscriptions for products you can reliably supply. Running out of a subscribed product creates customer service issues.

### Pricing
A 10% subscription discount is common. Balance customer value with your margins.

### Communication
Be clear about what subscribers get:
- Consistent product (same coffee each time)
- Automatic billing and shipping
- Easy management via portal
