# Inventory Management

Track and manage stock levels for your products.

## How Inventory Works

Each SKU variant tracks its own inventory count:

- **Stock quantity** - Current units available to sell
- Inventory decreases automatically when orders are placed
- Orders are blocked when stock reaches zero

## Viewing Inventory

### Product Level
1. Go to **Products**
2. Inventory status shown in product list
3. Click a product to see per-variant inventory

### Variant Level
1. Open a product
2. View **Variants** section
3. Each variant shows current stock

## Updating Stock

### Manual Update
1. Open the product
2. Find the variant
3. Click **Edit** on the variant
4. Update the stock quantity
5. Click **Save**

### When to Update
- After roasting a new batch
- When receiving inventory from suppliers
- After physical inventory counts
- To correct discrepancies

## Out of Stock

When a variant reaches zero stock:

- Product shows "Out of Stock" for that variant
- Customers cannot add it to cart
- Other variants of the same product remain available

## Stock Considerations

### Buffer Stock
Consider keeping a small buffer to account for:
- Damaged bags
- Quality control samples
- Last-minute order additions

### Subscription Stock
If offering subscriptions, reserve inventory for:
- Upcoming subscription renewals
- Plan for subscription demand in your roasting schedule

## Inventory Workflow

Typical workflow for coffee roasters:

1. **Plan roast** based on current inventory and orders
2. **Roast coffee**
3. **Update inventory** after bagging
4. **Ship orders** - inventory decreases automatically
5. **Monitor levels** - plan next roast

## Best Practices

- Update inventory promptly after roasting
- Do periodic physical counts to verify accuracy
- Set aside time weekly to review stock levels
- Plan roasts based on sell-through rate
