## Product Form Fields

| Name | Product name displayed to customers | Yes |
| Slug | URL identifier (auto-generated from name) | Yes |
| Description | Full product description | No |

### Visibility

- **Public** - Visible to all customers on storefront
- **Wholesale Only** - Only visible to approved wholesale accounts
- **Hidden** - Not shown on storefront (for draft products)

## Best Practices

### Product Names
- Keep names clear and descriptive
- Include origin if that's your naming convention
- Be consistent across your catalog

Good: "Ethiopia Yirgacheffe", "House Blend", "Decaf Colombia"
Avoid: "Coffee #1", "New Arrival"

### Descriptions
- Lead with what makes this coffee special
- Include brewing recommendations if relevant
- Keep it scannable with short paragraphs

### Coffee Attributes
- Fill in all attributes you have information for
- Consistent formatting helps customers filter and compare
- Update attributes if sourcing changes

## After Creating

Once a product is created:

1. **Add SKU variants** - Weight and grind options
2. **Upload images** - Product photos
3. **Set pricing** - Configure prices in price lists
4. **Check visibility** - Ensure it's set correctly for your audience

## Editing Products

1. Go to **Products**
2. Click on the product name
3. Make changes
4. Click **Save Product**

Changes take effect immediately on your storefront.

## Deleting Products

Products with order history cannot be deleted (for record-keeping). Instead:

1. Set visibility to **Hidden**
2. The product won't appear on your storefront
3. Historical orders still reference the product
